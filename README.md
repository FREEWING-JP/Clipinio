# Clipinio

I used to use ClipMenu as daily clipboard manager. As the recent version lacks of access to the source code I decided to switch. Thus I bought two clipboard manager from the App Store. Both did not work as I expected...so I wrote my own kinda lightweight clipboard manager. I wrote it in Swift as an introduction. This is nothing real awesome. Just fits my daily use case. Maybe I enhance it later. If anyone cares: I did not invoke the old carbon api as it felt unswifty implementing it.
